### How it works ⚙️
- Each light fades in and out using the CSS `animation` property
- The opacity of each light is controlled by the `@keyframes` rule
- The `animation-delay` property straggers the timing of the change
- The `box-shadow` property creates the glow effect for the lights
- The animation can be played / paused using the switch button
- Only CSS was used to create the animation and no JavaScript

### About CSS animations ℹ️
A [CSS animations](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp) let an element gradually change from one style to another. You can change as many CSS properties you want, as many times you want.
